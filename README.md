## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS3** (custom properties, Flexbox, Grid)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

During this challenge, I improved my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design. I also refined my skills in using CSS variables to manage colors and spacing more efficiently.

#### Example Code:
```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: var(--white);
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Experiment more with **CSS animations** for better user interactions
- Improve **accessibility** by focusing on keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Use **SCSS or Tailwind CSS** for better styling efficiency

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - A great guide to understanding Flexbox.
- [CSS Tricks - Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Helped me grasp the fundamentals of CSS Grid.
